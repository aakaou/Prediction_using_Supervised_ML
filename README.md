# Prediction_using_Supervised_ML
This repository contains the solution for Task 1 of the GRIP (The Sparks Foundation) Data Science and Business Analytics Internship. The task involves predicting the percentage of a student based on the number of study hours using a linear regression model.

# Dataset
The dataset for this task can be accessed from the following link: http://bit.ly/w-data.
The dataset consists of two columns: Hours (number of study hours) and Scores (percentage score achieved by the student). The objective is to build a linear regression model to predict the percentage score based on the number of study hours.

# Dependencies
The solution code has been implemented in Python, utilizing the following libraries:
    • pandas
    • numpy
    • matplotlib.pyplot
    • scikit-learn (sklearn) Make sure to have these libraries installed before running the code.
    
# Solution Steps
    1. Import the necessary libraries mentioned above.
    2. Load and visualize the dataset using pandas and matplotlib.pyplot.
    3. Split the dataset into training and testing sets using scikit-learn's train_test_split.
    4. Train the linear regression model on the training set.
    5. Test the model by predicting the scores for the testing set and evaluating its performance.
    6. Predict the percentage for a given number of study hours, specifically 9.25 hours per day.
    7. Visualize the results using a scatter plot to observe the model's performance.
